# 6.2 Cinematic Legacy Reveal

## 🎯 Goal
Transform the claim experience from a transactional file download into an emotional, respectful ceremony.

## 🎨 Visual Concept

### State 1: Locked
- **Visual:** A high-quality 3D Safe or Cyberpunk Monolith (using `Spline` or purely CSS 3D).
- **Animation:** Breathing glow, subtle rotation.
- **Interaction:** Mouse move affects lighting/perspective.

### State 2: The Reveal (Transition)
- **Trigger:** Decryption successful.
- **Animation:**
    1.  Main interface fades to black.
    2.  Sound design: Heavy mechanical unlocking sound + ethereal "release" chime.
    3.  The Safe/Monolith cracks open or dissolves into particles.

### State 3: The Message
- **Content:** If the owner left a text note or video, it plays **first**, alone on screen.
- **Context:** "A final message from [Name]"
- **Pacing:** User must finish reading/watching (or click "Continue") before seeing assets.

### State 4: Inheritance
- **Visual:** Grid of artifacts (Files, Tokens, Keys) fades in.
- **Style:** Premium cards, glassmorphism.

## 🛠️ Technical Plan
- **Libraries:**
    - `framer-motion` for layout transitions.
    - `@splinetool/react-spline` for 3D assets (lightweight).
    - `react-type-animation` for typewriter effect on text notes.
- **Asset Storage:**
    - Needs "Public" vs "Private" separation. The "Final Message" might need to be decrypted first but shown before the file download.

## ✅ Execution Steps
1.  [ ] Install `framer-motion`.
2.  [ ] Design "The Safe" component (CSS/SVG).
3.  [ ] Build `RevealSequence` component in `ClaimModal`.
4.  [ ] Add sound effects (optional).
