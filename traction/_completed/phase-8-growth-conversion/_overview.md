# Phase 8: Growth, SEO & Conversion Optimization

> "A great protocol is useless if no one understands why they need it."

## Objective
Transform the Deadman's Switch Landing Page from a functional "app entry" into a compelling "narrative experience" that educates users, drives organic traffic (SEO), and optimizes conversion rates.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Content Expansion (SEO Focus)
Move beyond simple feature listing. We need to address the *why* and capture long-tail search intent.
*   **The Problem**: Visualize the "Lost Crypto" problem ($ billions lost).
*   **Use Cases**: Target specific personas (Inheritance, Whistleblowing, Self-Custody).
*   **Objection Handling**: Proactive FAQ to address security/privacy fears.

### 2. Conversion Optimization (CRO)
Reduce friction and increase "time on site" and "emotional buy-in".
*   **Interactive Simulator**: "Show, Don't Tell". Let users play with the timeline.
*   **Social Proof**: On-chain stats transparency.
*   **Sticky CTA**: Make the "Create Vault" action omnipresent.

## Success Metrics
*   **SEO**: Rank for keywords like "crypto inheritance protocol", "solana dead man switch".
*   **Engagement**: Increase Average Time on Page > 2 mins.
*   **Conversion**: Increase `Visitor -> Connect Wallet` rate.
