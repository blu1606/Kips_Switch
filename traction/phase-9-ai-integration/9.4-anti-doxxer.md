# 9.4 The Anti-Doxxer (Privacy Guard)

> "Don't accidentally leak your secrets in public fields."

## 🎯 Goal
Prevent users from pasting sensitive info (Private Keys, Seed Phrases) into **Unencrypted Metadata** fields like `Title` or `Description`.

## 📐 The Problem
- Vault `Title` and `Public Description` are often stored on-chain or in IPFS metadata **without encryption** (for UI display).
- Users often copy-paste quickly and might paste a private key into the wrong box.
- Result: Instant loss of funds/privacy.

## 📐 Solution: Client-Side Content Scanner

Runs locally in the browser (Regex + Entropy Check). No heavy AI needed.

### 1. Detectable Patterns
- **Solana Private Key:** Base58 string, 87-88 chars.
- **EVM Private Key:** Hex string, 64 chars.
- **Seed Phrase:** 12/24 words from BIP39 list.
- **Credit Card:** 16 digits, Luhn check.

### 2. User Experience

```
User types in Title: "My Ledger Backup 5Kb8..."

🚨 WARNING: POTENTIAL SECRET DETECTED
"It looks like you pasted a Private Key in the Title field."

[Reasoning]
Titles are PUBLIC and NOT ENCRYPTED. Anyone can see this.

[Action]
👉 Move this to the 'Secret File' section?
[Move to Secret] [Ignore (I know what I'm doing)]
```

## 🛠️ Implementation (Regex Library)

```typescript
const DANGER_PATTERNS = [
  {
    name: 'Solana Private Key',
    regex: /[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{87,88}/,
    suggestion: 'Private Keys should be encrypted.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Seed Phrase',
    regex: /^([a-z]{3,}\s){11,23}[a-z]{3,}$/i, // Basic check
    suggestion: 'Seed phrases must never be public.'
  }
];

function scanInput(text: string) {
  for (const pattern of DANGER_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.regex.test(text)) {
      return { detected: true, type: pattern.name };
    }
  }
  return { detected: false };
}
```

## 💰 Cost
- **Zero.** Everything runs client-side.
- **High Value:** Saves user from catastrophic error.

## ✅ Steps
- [ ] Create `SafetyScanner.ts` utility
- [ ] Add `BIP39` wordlist for accurate seed checking
- [ ] Attach `onBlur` listener to Title/Description inputs
- [ ] Create "Security Alert" modal component
