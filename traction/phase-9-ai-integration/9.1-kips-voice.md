## 🎯 Goal
Make all system messages come from Kip's personality. Warm, playful, but never annoying.

## 📐 Message Categories

### A. Check-in Success
```
(• ◡ •)  "Yay! I'm full and happy! See you in 30 days~"
(^ _ ^)  "Thanks for the snack! Your secrets are safe with me."
(• ω •)  "Nom nom! I've got energy for another month!"
```

### B. Warning State (50% time passed)
```
(• _ •)  "Hey, it's been a while... I'm getting a bit hungry."
(• . •)  "Just checking in! Don't forget about me~"
(• ◡ •)? "Still here! But I could use some attention soon."
```

### C. Critical State (<24h)
```
(T _ T)  "I'm fading... please don't let me disappear."
(; _ ;)  "Only a few hours left... I don't want to go."
(• ~ •)  "This might be goodbye... I'll miss keeping your secrets."
```

### D. Released State (Ghost Kip)
```

```

## 📧 Email Subject Lines

## 🛠️ Implementation

### 1. Message Bank
```typescript
// src/lib/kip-messages.ts
export const KIP_MESSAGES = {
  success: [
    { face: "(• ◡ •)", text: "Yay! I'm full and happy!" },
    { face: "(^ _ ^)", text: "Thanks for the snack!" },
    // ... 10+ variations
  ],
  warning: [...],
  critical: [...],
  released: [...],
};

export function getRandomKipMessage(state: KipState) {
  const messages = KIP_MESSAGES[state];
  return messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
}
```

### 2. Dashboard Integration
```tsx
// After successful check-in
<KipMessage state="success" />

// Renders:
// (• ◡ •) "Yay! I'm full and happy!"
```

```html
<div style="text-align: center; font-family: monospace; font-size: 24px;">
  (• _ •)
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hey! It's been 25 days since you last fed me.
  I'm starting to feel a little faint...
</p>
<a href="{{check_in_link}}">
