# 8.1 Content Strategy & SEO Expansion

## The "PAS" Framework
We will restructure the landing page to follow the **Problem - Agitation - Solution** model.

### 1. "The Void" (Problem Section)
*   **Goal**: Create emotional urgency.
*   **Visual**: A dark, minimalist datascope showing fading numbers (representing lost value).
*   **Copy**:
    > "20% of all Bitcoin is lost forever. Keys forgotten, drives lost, or owners passed away without a plan. Don't let your legacy become a statistic."

### 2. Segmented Use Cases
Create dedicated content blocks for 3 key personas to capture SEO keywords:

#### A. Family Protector (Keyword: "Crypto Inheritance")
*   **Narrative**: "You hold the keys, but who holds them when you're gone?"
*   **Feature**: Multi-asset support, simplicity for non-tech heirs.

#### B. The Truth Teller (Keyword: "Whistleblower Switch")
*   **Narrative**: "Your insurance policy against silence."
*   **Feature**: Immutable, unstoppable on-chain execution.

#### C. Self-Custody Backup (Keyword: "Key Recovery")
*   **Narrative**: "A fail-safe for your fail-safes."
*   **Feature**: Automated checks, grace periods.

### 3. FAQ Section (Objection Handling)
Address the "Elephant in the room" - Trust.
*   *Can the dev team steal my funds?* (No, non-custodial).
*   *What if Supabase goes down?* (Protocol is fully on-chain).
*   *Is it audited?* (Open source, devnet beta).

## Technical SEO
*   **JSON-LD**: Add structured data (`SoftwareApplication`) for rich snippets.
*   **Semantic HTML**: Proper `<h1>`, `<h2>` hierarchy.
*   **Performance**: Lazy load heavy 3D elements below the fold for Core Web Vitals.
