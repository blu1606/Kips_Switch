# 8.4 Landing Page Refactor: The Integrated Tutorial

> **Problem:** Current landing page is too passive. "Try Demo" requires a click -> drop-off.
> **Solution:** Integrate the "Hook" (Claim Phase) directly into the Hero Section.

## 🧠 Deep Think: Single Page vs Dual Phase
User wants distinct phases: **Lock vs Claim**.
*   **Phase 1 (The Hook):** Recipient Experience. "You found a vault." -> Reveal.
*   **Phase 2 (The Pitch):** Owner Experience. "Now protect your own." -> Create.

## 🏗️ The New Hero Layout (Split Screen)

### Top Half: "The Discovery (Claim)"
**Context:** "Someone left you a digital legacy."
*   **UI Component:** `ClaimPortal` (Mocked).
*   **State:** Vault is *Ready to Release*.
*   **Action:** User clicks "Unlock Vault".
*   **Effect:**
    *   Cinematic Reveal Animation plays (Phase 6.2).
    *   3D Safe spins and opens.
    *   Typewriter text appears: *"If you are reading this, I am gone. Here are the keys..."*
    *   **Emotional Hook:** "This is what your loved ones will see."

### Bottom Half: "The Setup (Lock)"
**Context:** "Don't leave your assets to chance."
*   **UI Component:** `CreateWizard` (Mini Version).
*   **State:** Step 1/3 (Select Asset).
*   **Action:** User interacts with the wizard directly on the Landing Page.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  Select "100 SOL" (Mock).
    2.  Set Timer "30 Days".
    3.  **Authentication:** When they click "Create", *THEN* trigger the `Flash Onboarding` (Burner Wallet) or `Connect Wallet` modal.

## 🛠️ Technical Plan for `src/app/page.tsx`

Refactor `Home` component to manage a `tutorialStep` state (`CLAIM` | `CREATE`).

### Step A: The Claim Hero
```tsx
<motion.div layoutId="hero-card">
  <div className="badge">RECEIVED: 1 VAULT</div>
  <h1>Agent 007 left you a message.</h1>
  <button onClick={startReveal}>Unlock Vault</button>
  {isRevealed && <RevealSequenceReplay />}
</motion.div>
```

### Step B: The Transition
After reveal ends, show a strong CTA:
*"See? It works. Now secure your legacy."*

### Step C: The Create Hero
Smooth transition (replace the Claim Card with Create Card).
```tsx
<motion.div layoutId="hero-card">
  <h1>Your Turn.</h1>
  <MiniCreateWizard />
</motion.div>
```

## ✅ Execution Checklist
1.  [ ] Create `components/landing/HeroTutorial.tsx`.
2.  [ ] Implement `MockClaimFlow` (Hardcoded data).
3.  [ ] Implement `MiniCreateWizard` (Simplified steps).
4.  [ ] Replace current Hero in `page.tsx`.
