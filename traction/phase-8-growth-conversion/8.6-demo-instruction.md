# Phase 8.6: Flash Onboarding Demo Instruction

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed plan for upgrading the Flash Onboarding flow (`/demo`) to serve as a high-fidelity interactive tutorial. The goal is to maximize conversion by letting users "play" with the real app interface in a risk-free, accelerated environment.

DO NOT "dumb down" the UI. Replicate the authentic "Digital Immortality" experience.

## Narrative Flow

### 1. The Discovery (State: `CLAIMING`)
**Goal:** Hook the user with the reward (Greed/Curiosity).
- **Context:** User lands instantly on a "Vault Found" screen (skipping generic intro).
- **UI:** Reuses `VaultCard` + `ClaimModal` (from `/claim`).
- **Action:**
    - User sees a locked vault card "Agent 007 Legacy".
    - Click `Claim` -> Shows `ClaimModal` (Mock Decrypting animation).
    - Success -> Reveal "100 USDC" reward.
- **Bot (Kip):** "Look! A dormant vault has been found. The owner didn't check in. Claim it now!"

### 2. The Setup (State: `CREATING`)
**Goal:** Show how easy it is to protect that reward (Fear/Security).
- **Context:** "You found money. Now protect it."
- **UI:** Reuses `TunnelLayout` + Wizard Steps (from `/create`).
- **Steps:**
    1.  **Asset:** Auto-selected "100 USDC" (from Step 1).
    2.  **Recipient:** "Set a beneficiary" (Mock input).
    3.  **Anti-Theft (New):** "Wait! What if someone forces you to unlock it?" -> Show "Silent Alarm" / "Duress Mode" tip.
    4.  **Confirm:** "Create Vault" (Gas fee simulated).
- **Bot (Kip):** "Smart move. Now set up your own Deadman's Switch. It takes 2 minutes."

### 3. The Lifecycle (State: `LIVE` -> `DYING`)
**Goal:** Demonstrate the core mechanic (Urgency/Relief).
- **UI:** Reuses `VaultDashboard` (or similar high-fidelity card).
- **Action:**
    - Timer ticks down fast (10s total).
    - **Check-in:** Clicking resets timer (Relief).
    - **Panic:** Let it expire -> "Vault Released".
- **Bot (Kip):** "Tick tock... if you vanish, the protocol acts. Try 'Fast Forward' to see what happens when you die."

## Technical Constraints
- **Assets:** Reuse `src/components/claim/*` and `src/components/wizard/*` visual styles strictly.
- **Isolation:** Do NOT modify the real components if they are tightly coupled to `useWallet`. Copy layout/classes into new `Demo*` wrappers if necessary.
- **Positioning:** Kip moves to Top-Right to avoid blocking main content.
