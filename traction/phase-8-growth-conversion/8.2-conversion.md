# 8.2 Conversion Optimization (CRO)

## Interactive Elements
Static text is boring. We need "Visceral" interactions that prove the value instantly.

### The "What If" Simulator
A mini-app embedded in the Landing Page.
*   **Input**: A slider for "Check-in Interval" (e.g., 30 Days).
*   **Visualization**: A timeline that animates:
    1.  **Day 0**: You Check In. (Green Pulse).
    2.  **Day 15**: Silence... (Yellow Warning).
    3.  **Day 29**: "Grace Period" emails sent. (Orange Alert).
    4.  **Day 30**: 🚨 **TRIGGER**. Vault Decrypts. Assets Transferred.

### Trust Indicators
*   **"Devnet Stats" Ticker**: Real-time fetch of:
    *   Total Vaults Created.
    *   Total SOL Secured (Mock data for now, or Devnet real data).
*   **Github Badge**: "Open Source & Verifiable".

### UX Friction Removal
*   **Sticky CTA**: As the user scrolls through the "Problem" and "Use Cases", a subtle "Create Vault" button should appear in the navigation bar/bottom corner.
*   **One-Click Demo**: A "Try Demo" mode that fills the Create form with dummy data so users can see the dashboard without connecting a wallet (optional/future).
