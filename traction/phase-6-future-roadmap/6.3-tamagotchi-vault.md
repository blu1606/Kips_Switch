# 6.3 The Tamagotchi Vault (Gamification)

## 🎯 Goal
Turn the chore of "checking in" into a rewarding, habit-forming game loop (Digital Pet).

## 👾 Concept
Every Vault comes with a soulbound **"Keeper Spirit"** (NFT). The state of the Vault directly affects the appearance and metadata of the Spirit.

### States
1.  **Happy/Glowing:** `lastCheckIn < 24h`
2.  **Neutral:** `24h < lastCheckIn < 7 days`
3.  **Sick/Fading:** `lastCheckIn > 7 days` (User is neglecting the vault)
4.  **Ghost (Released):** Vault expired/released.

### Mechanics
- **Feed:** `ping()` transaction = "Feed" action.
- **Streak:** Consecutive successful check-ins build a "Streak" counter in metadata.
- **Evolution:** High streak = Spirit evolves (Egg -> Baby -> Guardian).

## 🛠️ Technical Plan
- **Standard:** Use Metaplex Core or pNFT (Programmable NFT).
- **Updates:**
    - Option A (On-chain): Contract updates NFT metadata URI on `ping()`. Expensive (rent).
    - Option B (Dynamic Rendering): NFT Image URL points to a server generating images on-the-fly based on Vault state (read from chain). Cheaper, easier.

## ✅ Execution Steps
1.  [ ] Design 4 states of the "Keeper Spirit" (Midjourney/Stable Diffusion).
2.  [ ] Create API to serve dynamic NFT image (`/api/nft/[vault_address]/image.png`).
3.  [ ] Mint NFT upon Vault creation (or optional opt-in).
