# 6.4 The Council of Guardians (Social Recovery)

## 🎯 Goal
Provide a human-layer safety net beyond simple time-based triggers. Prevent accidental releases due to temporary incapacitation (coma, jail, lost device).

## 🛡️ Concept
Owner designates **Guardians** (trusted friends/family). They act as a fail-safe.

### Scenario A: Time expired, but Guardians say "Wait!"
- Standard Deadman's Switch relies solely on time.
- **Improvement:** When Timer = 0, Vault enters "Provisional Release" state for 48h.
- Guardians notified. They can vote to **Veto** (extend timer) if they know Owner is alive but stuck (e.g., in hospital).

### Scenario B: Owner lost keys (Social Recovery)
- Owner cannot access wallet.
- Owner asks Guardians to help.
- **M-of-N Guardians** (e.g., 3 of 5) sign a transaction to `rotate_owner_key(new_pubkey)`.

## 🛠️ Technical Plan
- **Contract:**
    - `guardians: Vec<Pubkey>`
    - `guardian_threshold: u8`
    - New instructions: `add_guardian`, `remove_guardian`, `guardian_vote`, `rotate_owner`.
- **UI:** "Guardian Portal" where friends connect wallet to vote.

## ✅ Execution Steps
1.  [ ] Update Rust Contract (Significant logic change).
2.  [ ] Create Guardian Portal UI.
3.  [ ] Audit widely (High security risk if buggy).

**Note:** This is an "Enterprise/Pro" feature.
