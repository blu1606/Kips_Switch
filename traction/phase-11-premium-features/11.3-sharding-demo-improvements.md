# Guardian Key Sharding Demo Improvements

## 🎯 Goal
Improve the clarity and logical integrity of the Guardian Key Sharding feature in the onboarding wizard. The current implementation uses a mock visualization which, while effective for the hackathon demo, creates a security ambiguity where users might believe they are genuinely protected.

## 🚨 Issues (from Review)
- **Misleading UX**: Users might think sharding is active and effective immediately, but the shards are generated via a mock hash and **not stored**.
- **Security Ambiguity**: No visual indication that this is a "Demo" or "Simulation".

## 📐 Design

### 1. UI Clarity (Immediate Fix)
- Add a **"DEMO MODE"** badge to the `KeyShardingDemo` component.
- Add a tooltip or disclaimer: *"This is a simulation of the key splitting process. In the final version, you will download your shards."*

### 2. Logic Integrity (Hackathon Fix)
- Replace the `mockShamirSplit` function with the real `secrets.js-grempe` library (which is already used in `KeyRecoveryDemo`).
- Even if we don't force a download flow yet, the shards shown should be mathematically valid to ensure the "Recovery" demo actually works with real input if the user tries to copy-paste.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. Update `KeyShardingDemo.tsx`
- [ ] Import `secrets.js-grempe`.
- [ ] Replace `mockShamirSplit` with `secrets.share(masterKey, 3, 2)`.
- [ ] Add "DEMO / SIMULATION" badge in the header.

### 2. Verify Data Flow
- [ ] Ensure the generated shards in `KeyShardingDemo` are passed up to `StepConfirm` (even if just logged for now).
- [ ] Verify `KeyRecoveryDemo` can reconstruct the key if a user manually inputs the hex strings from the Sharding step.

## ✅ Verification
- **Visual**: "DEMO" badge is visible.
- **Functional**: Copying shards from "Splitting" step and pasting into "Recovery" step successfully reconstructs the Master Key.
