# 15.2: Gasless Transactions (Paymaster)

## Overview
Remove the requirement for users to hold SOL for transaction fees by using the LazorKit Paymaster service.

## Key Benefits
- **Zero-SOL Onboarding:** New users can create vaults immediately.
- **Improved UX:** No more "insufficient SOL" errors during critical moments.
- **Sponsored Claims:** Recipients can claim vaults without needing to buy SOL first.

## Technical Details

- [ ] Test sponsored transaction flow on Devnet.
- [ ] Add UI indicators for "Sponsored" or "Gasless" actions.
