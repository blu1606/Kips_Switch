| **[00-brand-philosophy.md](./00-brand-philosophy.md)** | Why "Cute" reduces anxiety for crypto users. The "Friendly Guardian" strategy. |
| **[01-character-design.md](./01-character-design.md)** | Visual specs for **Kip**. States: Healthy, Hungry, Critical, Ghost. |
| **[02-ui-integration.md](./02-ui-integration.md)** | Placing Kip in the Dashboard, Check-in flow, and Loading states. |

## 🌟 The Core Concept
**"Kip"** is a bioluminescent cryptoplasm. He eats heartbeats (check-ins) to stay alive. If he starves, he fades away and releases the secrets he was holding.

## 🚀 Execution Summary
1.  **Asset Creation:** Need vector SVGs of the 4 emotional states.
2.  **Dashboard:** Place Kip near the Check-in Timer.
3.  **Interaction:** "Feed" Kip by holding the check-in button.
