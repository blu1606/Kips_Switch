# 16.2: UI Component Decomposition

## 🎯 Objective
Break down "God Components" into smaller, single-responsibility UI pieces.

## 🛠 Decomposition Strategy

### 1. `StepConfirm.tsx` Refactor
- **Core Component:** Maintains layout and state orchestration using `useCreateVault`.
- **Sub-components:**
  - `VaultSummaryCards`: Visual summary of file, recipient, and interval.
  - `AssetLockForm`: UI for entering and validating SOL lock amount.
  - `EmailNotificationsForm`: Form for entering owner and recipient emails.

### 2. `ClaimModal.tsx` Refactor
- **Core Component:** Orchestrates the multi-state transition using `useVaultUnlock`.
- **Sub-components:**
  - `ClaimInputView`: Password/Wallet input UI.
  - `ClaimUnlockingView`: Safe animation UI.
  - `ClaimMessageView`: Typewriter message effect.
  - `ClaimAssetsView`: Asset cards, metadata preview, and action buttons.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Both `StepConfirm.tsx` and `ClaimModal.tsx` are under 250 lines total.
- [ ] Sub-components are stored in sub-folders (e.g., `src/components/claim/sub/`).
- [ ] Prop drilling is minimized by using the new logic hooks directly where possible.
